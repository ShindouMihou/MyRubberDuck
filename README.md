[My Rubber Duck ðŸ¦†](https://rubberduck.mihou.pw) is a platform where one can privately chat with themselves without any external servers receiving your messages. The platform was created to help software engineers stop making their friends into rubber ducks and make themselves into rubber ducks instead.

In this platform, there is no backend server that stores the messages or anything. All messages are stored on your local storage to make sure that you are 
not violating any NDAs by disclosing your rants that might contain your company's properties or related. If you are disclosing anything related to NDA then 
and want to clear them, feel free to clear your messages anytime with the trash bin button.

This platform serves no other purpose but for people to rant on themselves and somehow figure out a solution for their problems amidst their rants, thereby, earning it the name of a rubber duck.

You can start ranting to yourself via our Cloudflare Pages-hosted website at [My Rubber Duck ðŸ¦†](https://rubberduck.mihou.pw)

### ðŸ¤” Top text-bar layout on mobile?

Android, iOS and tablet users may notice the text bar is located at the top of the website, the answer to this is because of an issue with mobile devices and possibly tablet where the text-bar would be hidden by the keyboard. I tried multiple methods and the most safe way to resolve this issue is to have the keyboard positioned at the top for mobile and tablet devices.
